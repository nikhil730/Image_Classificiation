# Image_Classificiation
image classification using CIFAR10 dataset in tensorflow. We will use convolutional neural network for this image classification problem. First we will train a model using simple artificial neural network and then check how the performance looks like and then we will train a CNN and see how the model accuracy improves.
With ANN the Accuracy was 49% and with CNN the accuracy increased to 70%.
